My very first HTML/CSS code I've made. This page is based on a task that was provided by FreeCodeCamp.org. I worked on this code on a site call codepen.io .

Basically the whole premise of this code, is to use my knowleddge of HTML/CSS to use. I used the div tag to define different sections of the web page. I used ul to initialize the list with bulletsand and li to create the list of facts it self. the script allows me  to link a custom script to check if i include everything.
